Workflows
=========

sasoptpy can work with both client-side data and server-side data.
Some limitations to the functionalities might apply in terms of which
workflow is used. In this section, the overall flow of the package
is explained.

Client-side models
------------------

If the data are client-side (Python), then a concrete model is generated
on the client and is uploaded by using one of the available CAS actions.

Using a client-side model brings several advantages, such as directly accessing
variables, expressions, and constraints. You can more easily perform computationally intensive
operations such as filtering data, sorting values, changing variable values,
and printing expressions.

There are two main disadvantages of working with client-side models.
First, if your model is relatively large, the generated
MPS DataFrame or OPTMODEL code might allocate a large amount of memory on your
machine.
Second, the information that needs to be passed from client to server
might be larger than it would be if you use a server-side model.

See the following representation of the client-side model workflow for CAS (Viya) servers:

Steps of modeling a simple knapsack problem are shown in the following subsections.

1. Reading data:

   .. ipython:: python

      import sasoptpy as so
      import pandas as pd
      from swat import CAS

      session = CAS(hostname, port)
      m = so.Model(name='client_CAS', session=session)

      data = [
          ['clock', 8, 4, 3],
          ['mug', 10, 6, 5],
          ['headphone', 15, 7, 2],
          ['book', 20, 12, 10],
          ['pen', 1, 1, 15]
          ]

      df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['item', 'value', 'weight', 'limit'])
      ITEMS = df.index
      value = df['value']
      weight = df['weight']
      limit = df['limit']
      total_weight = 55

   .. ipython:: python

      print(type(ITEMS), ITEMS)

   .. ipython:: python

      print(type(total_weight), total_weight)


   Here, you can obtain the column values one by one:

   >>> df = df.set_index('item')
   >>> ITEMS = df.index.tolist()
   >>> value = df['value']
   >>> weight = df['weight']
   >>> limit = df['limit']

2. Creating the optimization model:

   .. ipython:: python

      # Variables
      get = m.add_variables(ITEMS, name='get', vartype=so.INT, lb=0)

      # Constraints
      m.add_constraints((get[i] <= limit[i] for i in ITEMS), name='limit_con');
      m.add_constraint(
          so.expr_sum(weight[i] * get[i] for i in ITEMS) <= total_weight,
          name='weight_con');

      # Objective
      total_value = so.expr_sum(value[i] * get[i] for i in ITEMS)
      m.set_objective(total_value, name='total_value', sense=so.MAX);

      # Solve
      m.solve(verbose=True)

   You can display the generated OPTMODEL code at run time by using the :code:`verbose=True` option.
   Here, you can see the coefficient values of the parameters inside the model.

3. Parsing the results:

   After the solve, the primal and dual solution tables are obtained. You can print
   the solution tables by using the :meth:`Model.get_solution` method.

   It is also possible to print the optimal solution by using
   the :func:`get_solution_table` function.

   .. ipython:: python

      print(m.get_solution())

   .. ipython:: python

      print(so.get_solution_table(get, key=ITEMS))

   .. ipython:: python

      print('Total value:', total_value.get_value())


Server-side models
------------------

If the data are server-side (CAS or SAS), then an abstract model
is generated on the client. This abstract model is later converted to
PROC OPTMODEL code, which reads the data on the server.

The main advantage of the server-side models is faster upload times compared
to client-side models. This is especially noticeable when using large numbers of
variable and constraint groups.

The only disadvantage of using server-side models is that variables often need 
to be accessed directly from the resulting SASDataFrame objects. Because
components of the models are abstract, accessing objects directly is often
not possible.

See the following representation of the server-side model workflow for CAS (Viya) servers:

.. image:: ../_static/images/serverside_cas.png

See the following representation of the server-side model workflow for SAS clients:

.. image:: ../_static/images/serverside_sas.png

In the following steps, the same example is solved by using server-side
data.

1. Creating the optimization model:

   .. ipython:: python

      from sasoptpy.actions import read_data

      m = so.Model(name='client_CAS', session=session)


   .. ipython:: python

      cas_table = session.upload_frame(df, casout='data')


   .. ipython:: python

      ITEMS = m.add_set(name='ITEMS', settype=so.STR)
      value = m.add_parameter(ITEMS, name='value')
      weight = m.add_parameter(ITEMS, name='weight')
      limit = m.add_parameter(ITEMS, name='limit')

      m.include(read_data(
         table=cas_table, index={'target':ITEMS, 'key': 'item'},
         columns=[value, weight, limit]))

      # Variables
      get = m.add_variables(ITEMS, name='get', vartype=so.INT, lb=0)

      # Constraints
      m.add_constraints((get[i] <= limit[i] for i in ITEMS), name='limit_con');
      m.add_constraint(
          so.expr_sum(weight[i] * get[i] for i in ITEMS) <= total_weight,
          name='weight_con');


   .. ipython:: python

      # Objective
      total_value = so.expr_sum(value[i] * get[i] for i in ITEMS)
      m.set_objective(total_value, name='total_value', sense=so.MAX);

      # Solve
      m.solve(verbose=True)


2. Parsing the results:

   .. ipython:: python

      # Print results
      print(m.get_solution())

   .. ipython:: python

      print('Total value:', m.get_objective_value())

   Because there is no direct access to expressions and variables, the optimal
   solution is printed by using the server response.

Limitations
-----------

- In SAS Viya, nonlinear models can be solved only by using the runOptmodel action, which
  requires SAS Viya 3.4 or later.
- User-defined decomposition blocks are available only in MPS mode, and therefore work only with client-side data.
- Mixed usage (client-side and server-side data) might not work in some cases.
  A quick fix would be transferring the data in either direction.
